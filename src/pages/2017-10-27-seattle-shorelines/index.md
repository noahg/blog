Seattle has a stock of inaccessible public shorelines that just waiting for community groups to develop. I built a map of them which you can see at [SeattleShorelines.org](https://www.seattleshorelines.org). 

This past year I have been staying healthy by paddling my butt off with the Seattle Outrigger Canoe Club. 

My goal for this project is to inspire neighorhood groups to apply for permits to develop [Seattle's Shoreline Street Ends](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/stuse_stends.htm).

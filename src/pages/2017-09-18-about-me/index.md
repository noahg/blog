I created this blog to share my insights, learnings, and opinions. 

I have been practicing mindfulness meditation and studying Buddhist
thought for more than 10 years. I'm often inspired to share **insights** from these experiences and reflections.

I enjoy **learning** new things and learn most effectively when communicating what I have learned.
Lately, I have been learning about immune-system strengthening, outrigger canoe paddling, adaptive/evolutionary economics, front-end development with Angular(x) and React, geospatial analysis, machine learning, transformational organizing, financial independence, fine woodworking, plaster slip-casting, vegetable fermentation, MOBAs, cannabis as medicine, and bluegrass/old-timey banjo.

I care very much about the health and happiness of the world and all the people, animals, and plants that inhabit it. This compels me to offer my **opinions** on policy, electoral strategy, and political theory. 

I cook often, garden less than I would like to, and aim to have at least one good conversation with my spouse, close friend, or family member each day.

My favorite activities are surfing, paddling, cross-country skiing, yoga, making campfires, and dancing to hip-hop / electronic / pop music.
